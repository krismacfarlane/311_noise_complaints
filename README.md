# 311_noise_complaints

- This is just a simple [Leaflet](http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/) map using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. 
- I used the the NYC Open Data API, specifically [311 Service Requests from 2010 - present](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9?)
  - I used noise complaints in the Bronx from 01/01/2015 - 01/08/2015.

- Icons are from [Leaflet Awesome Markers](https://github.com/lvoogdt/Leaflet.awesome-markers).
